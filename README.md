# NautilusAR

This repo contains only the Assets and ProjectSettings folder for the Nautilus AR mobile app. All other project folders will be automatically generated by Unity upon opening of the project. 

Because the Hercules and Argus models are property of the Ocean Exploration Trust, they are not included in this repo. As a temporary replacement, in the Assets > Models > herc  and Assets > Models > Argus folders, the Hercules and Argus models are replaced with a generic sphere model stand-in.
